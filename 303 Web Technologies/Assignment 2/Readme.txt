For all programs, proper questions are asked at input and proper answer are given in english in output

Point of the matter is, all programs involve System.out.print() statements, other than calculation statements

NOTE:
Only Question 6 (since console program) doesn't asks for user input explicity...you need to give input at console level
Rest all questions asks for input, show output (in words) / (explicity)
